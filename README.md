## Title: Text Analysis and Clustering of Multiple XML Articles

### Overview:
Implemented a comprehensive text analysis and clustering system for multiple XML articles. The project includes web scraping of XML data, text preprocessing, and the application of natural language processing (NLP) techniques to uncover insights. The key steps involve data extraction, cleaning, visualization, and clustering using **K-Means**.


### A. Key Features
* **Data Collection:** Scraped data from multiple XML articles, extracting relevant text information for analysis.

* **Text Preprocessing:** Conducted thorough text cleaning, including the removal of stopwords, punctuation, and lemmatization for better analysis.

* **Word Cloud Visualization:** Visualized the most frequent words in the dataset using a Word Cloud, providing an intuitive representation of the textual content.

* **Frequency Distribution:** Plotted the frequency distribution of words in the dataset to identify common terms and patterns.

* **Clustering with K-Means:** Applied K-Means clustering to group similar articles based on their content, allowing for a deeper understanding of the underlying structure.

* **Elbow Method Analysis:** Utilized the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters, enhancing the efficiency of the clustering process.

### B. File Structure

* **XML Articles:** Directory containing XML articles for analysis.
* **Clustering_WordCloud.py:** Jupyter notebook containing the complete code for data collection, preprocessing, and clustering.

### C. How to Use

**1] Dataset Setup:**
* Ensure that XML articles are stored in the "XML Articles" directory or update the file paths in the provided notebook accordingly.

**2] Spyder IDE:**
* Open and run the **'Clustering_WordCloud.py'** file inside the Spyder IDE.
* Follow the step-by-step instructions for data preprocessing, visualization, and clustering.

**3]Exploration and Customization:**

* Explore the generated visualizations, such as Word Clouds and frequency distributions, to gain insights into the dataset.
* Customize clustering parameters or try different clustering algorithms for further analysis.
